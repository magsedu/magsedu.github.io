I am PhD Researcher at the European University Institute. My research focuses on comparative politics and historical political economy. I aim to understand how gender norms are shaped and how they can be challenged, asking questions as: How do historical experiences affect current gender norms? What explains differences in gender norms among similar countries? More precisely, I am interested in understanding how women form a collective identity, position themselves in society and challenge patriarchal systems.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
