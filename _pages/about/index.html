My research focuses on comparative politics and historical political economy. I aim to understand how gender norms are shaped and how they can be challenged, asking questions as: How do historical experiences affect current gender norms? What explains differences in gender norms among similar countries? More precisely, I am interested in understanding how women form a collective identity, position themselves in society and challenge patriarchal systems.</p> </body></html>
